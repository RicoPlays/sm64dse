#summary SM64DSe TODO aka World Domination Plan

= TODO =

There's no particular priority order unless stated otherwise.

== Linux ==

* fix the issues with GLControl (those little bastards overlap everything and ruin the active form's rendering)
* make a Linux build with Monodevelop (will perhaps fix the aforementioned issue)

== Model importer ==

* remove the texture scaling trick (it only works on emulators)
* add user-friendly warnings when potential problems are detected (like the aforementioned texture scaling issues)
* show a BMD-ified preview of the model rather than a direct preview?
* interface for assigning collision behaviors per-material and per-polygon
* more user-friendly interface

== 3D rendering & co. ==

* generalize the ObjectRenderer system to everything
* move GL code out of BMD.cs (will be doable after the aforementioned item is done)
* put writing code in BMD.cs and KCL.cs to make the model importer code cleaner, and possibly allow for small modifications to existing models

== NitroROM & co. ==

* make that code less weird
* make it so that the NARC parsing code isn't redundant with the NitroROM parsing code (aka make a generalized NitroFS class or something)
