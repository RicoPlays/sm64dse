# Reporting issues #

  * Give as much details as possible. If the issue is an exception message, copy-paste all the contents of the textbox if possible, otherwise attach a screenshot of the error.
  * DO NOT report issues related to cross-platform compatibility. Running SM64DSe on other platforms than Windows may be possible but isn't supported officially. This may or may not change within the next release.

Issue reports that don't comply with the rules above, will be removed.

# Commenting & rating revisions #

  * No insults or crap in comments. Use common sense. Unacceptable comments will be removed.
  * If you're going to give a negative rating to a revision, explain why in a constructive comment. Failure to do so will result in revision comments/ratings being restricted to project members.

# Contributing #

  * To get commit access, you should first send a code patch of yours to Mega-Mario (thetotalworm at gmail dot com). If your code is good, you'll be added as a committer. Exceptions to this rule may happen if you can show other proofs of your coding skills (like having contributed to a certain project).
  * Try to respect the original coding style as much as possible. And keep your code clean.
  * Shitting over the code will get your commit access permanently revoked.
